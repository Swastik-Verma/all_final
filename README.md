# 📰 Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines (DJIA)

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict stock market trends — specifically for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) — based on daily news headlines.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Built an end-to-end NLP pipeline to classify stock movement (Up or Down) using news headline data.
- Applied text preprocessing steps including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- Extracted features using a bigram-based Bag of Words (BoW) model.
- Trained and evaluated multiple models:
  - ✅ Logistic Regression (best-performing)
  - Random Forest
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Deployed the final model using **Flask** on **Railway** for real-time predictions.
